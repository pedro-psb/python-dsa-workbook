# Data Structures and Algorithms in python

This is where I practice implementing DSA in a more systematic way.
The base for these is the book "Data Structures and Algorithms and Python (2013)" by T Goodrich, R Tamasia, M Goldwasser.

The main goal here is to craft robust implemenetations and good design.

## Program Draft

- single linked list
    - abstract data type
    - stack
    - queue
- circularly linked list
    - abstract data type
    - round-robin schedulers
    - queue
- doubly linked list
    - abstract data type
    - deck
    - positional list

## Wishlist

- Setup a doc generator to produce a good looking doc for the modules with:
    - Standard API (types and docstring)
    - Time/space complexity analysis
    - Sample usage with comments
- Add the book question/answer (which currently is not being tracked) into this doc-site
